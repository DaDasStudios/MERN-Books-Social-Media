# Social Media of books
A complete social media to share your favorite books with others, including a system of roles and permissions for ensuring a better ciber-security. 
Also, you can see your own books and choose which are public or private and see your bookshelf with all the books (with a enjoyable GUI based on the 
**Apple** style. Besides, the application allows you to handle the data of your account.

### History
This application was created in order to put into actions all the concepts that I learned until the moment, so I tried to implement them as well as 
possible in order to give the best user experience like if the application was actually being on real production.

### Deployment
When I ended the project and deployed the project to my favorite hosting service which was **Heroku** everything was workink perfectly.
How ever, Heroku announced some week ago that the free service won't available anymore, so that all the Dynos was closed unless people pay 
again. That's why I can't deploy the whole project, because it needs a REST API to work fine. Anyhow, I'll be figuring out other service for
free hosting and deploy the project once again.
